## [Please see my github wiki for this web app!](https://github.com/nmerris/Job-Pro-5K/wiki)
#### [Or go straight to the app live on Heroku](https://job-pro-5000.herokuapp.com/)
***
NOTE: This is the final version of this app.  This git repository only shows the last handful of commits I made for this project.  I started a new git repo before deploying to heroku because I was having remote database issues.  If you would like to see the full commit history (55 additional commits), [check it out here.](https://github.com/nmerris/Job-Pro-5K-original)


#### Note to anyone deploying this app to Heroku

* you must create a postgresql database before pushing to heroku
* and you must change the pom and properties files to use postgresql instead of mysql
