## [Please see my github wiki for this web app!](https://github.com/nmerris/Job-Pro-5K/wiki)
#### [Or go straight to the app live on Heroku](https://job-pro-5000.herokuapp.com/)

_Please note that Heroku can sometimes have an exceedingly slow response time at first, so if the welcome page doesn't load on the first try, it should on the second try.  After it 'wakes up' the pages should respond well._
***
NOTE: This is the final version of this app.  This git repository only shows the last handful of commits I made for this project.  I started a new git repo before deploying to heroku because I was having remote database issues.  If you would like to see the full commit history (54 additional commits), [check it out here.](https://github.com/nmerris/Job-Pro-5K-original)


#### Note to anyone deploying this app to Heroku

* you must create a postgresql database before pushing to heroku
* and you must change the pom and properties files to use postgresql instead of mysql
